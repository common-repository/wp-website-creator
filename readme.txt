What wp-website-creator does for you

With WP Website Creator, you can provide your website visitors a WordPress installation by using a simple form.
Your visitor send the form and a WordPress website will be installed immediately.
Your visitor (new customer) get's his website access 10 minutes after sending the form.

Our system creates a zip file with the chosen theme and all the content that the customer submitted via the form.
Next, the system transfers the zip file to your server or your customers hosting.

After finishing the installation, the system sends all data back to your website.
Therefore a new post type "WPWCreator->Websites" will be created on your website.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How does the Website Creator work? =

After one of your clients has registered on the integrated form, a WordPress website with the design chosen by the client is directly installed on your server/host.

If you have cPanel or plesk the system will install the website automatically over the API. If you do not have a server you can temporarily install the websites on our server.


= Do I need any additional plugins? =

All required plugins are free of charge (Beaverbuilder light, Caldera Form). But you will only have access to six simple designs as long as you are using the FREE Membership.
